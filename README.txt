This ZIP folder with name "Project1_CSC574"contains the following files.They are :
1)crack.c
2)Makefile
3)crack
4)Project Report: project1 report csc 574
5)README

How to compile the code?
Here are the steps to complile the code
1)Get the Zip file and extract all its contents
2)Using terminal go to the extracted files directory
3)run "make" in terminal
4)./crack pathname of .wep file. Example:  "./crack log1.wep"

Everything works as per the specifications given.
Here is compiled results ran in our system using log.wep files provided in the project website.

Obstacles Encountered:
The algorithm was difficult to understand initially. We both have repeatedly discussed the algorithm for us to make sense.
Dr.Harfoush made our job much easier by discussing the algorithm briefly in the class.
